		<h1><strong>POLLUTION</strong></h1><br/>
		<img src="earth.jpg"/>
		<p>Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change. Pollution can take the form of any substance (solid, liquid, or gas) or energy (such as radioactivity, heat, sound, or light). Pollutants, the components of pollution, can be either foreign substances/energies or naturally occurring contaminants. Although environmental pollution can be caused by natural events, the word pollution generally implies that the contaminants have an anthropogenic sourceâ€”that is, a source created by human activities. Pollution is often classed as point source or nonpoint source pollution. In 2015, pollution killed 9 million people worldwide.</p><br/>
